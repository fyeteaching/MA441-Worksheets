\section{Related Rates}\label{related-rates}}

In many real-world applications, related variables are changing with
respect to a same variable. For example, the volume \(V\) and height
\(h\) of water in a cylindrical tank change with respect to time \(t\).
Such two rates of change, for example,
\(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t}\) and
\(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}h}{\mathrm{d}t}\) are called \textbf{related rates}.

To solve a related rate problem, the following strategy will be helpful.

\textbf{Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem}

\begin{enumerate}[sepno]
\item
  Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a figure
  if applicable.
\item
  State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and
  the rate to be determined.
\item
  Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1.
\item
  Using the chain rule, differentiate both sides of the equation found
  in step 3 with respect to the independent variable. This new equation
  will relate the derivatives.
\item
  Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve
  for the unknown rate of change.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}

A \(13\)-ft ladder is leaning against a wall. If the bottom of the
ladder slides away from the wall at a rate \(2\) ft/min, how fast is the
top of the ladder slides down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is
\(12\) ft from the wall.

constant rate of \(3\) ft/sec.~What is the rate that the tip of the
shadow moves away from the pole when the person is \(10\) ft away from
the pole?

is \(85\) square centimeters?

man is viewing the plane from a position \(3000\) ft from the base of a

east of airplane A and \(40\) miles north of airplane B, at what rate is
